    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Runs a command and handles user confirmation and error handling.

    .DESCRIPTION
    The RunCommand function prompts the user for confirmation before executing a command. If the user chooses to proceed with all subsequent commands, the function executes the remaining commands without further confirmation. The function also logs the command output to a file named "scoop_log.txt" and handles any errors that may occur during command execution.

    .PARAMETER command
    The command to be executed.

    .EXAMPLE
    RunCommand "scoop install git"
    RunCommand "scoop update"
    #>
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]

        } elseif ($confirmation -eq "N") {
            Write-Host "Installation skipped."
            return  # Exit the function
        } elseif ($confirmation -eq "A") {
            $yesToAll = $true
            break  # Proceed with execution for all subsequent commands
        } else {
            Write-Host "Invalid input. Please enter 'Y', 'N', or 'A'."
        }
