The concept of integrating a formal theory DSL with an NLP agent in a version-controlled environment offers an intricate blend of software engineering, artificial intelligence, and formal logic. Given the complexity of your vision, it will be necessary to establish an incremental approach, where each version adds a progressive layer of functionality and abstraction.

Here's an outline for an initial version in Python. The enclosed source code will focus on setting up a basic NLP agent that operates in a simulated Unix-like environment. The agent can respond to simple commands and outputs results. Future versions would build upon this base to incorporate more advanced logic and agent capabilities, such as interacting with an API and contributing iteratively to a knowledge base.

Please note that this example is skeletal and intended to be illustrative, serving as a starting point for more sophisticated implementations:


# --- Start of the fenced Python code block: main.py ---

import sys
import random
import datetime

# Basic command function definitions
def ls():
    # This function simulates the 'ls' Unix command within the agent's knowledge
    return "active_memory.txt reflection_notes.md goals.log"

def cd(directory):
    # Simulate changing directories, could also change agent's state or focus
    return f"Changed directory to {directory}"

def pwd():
    # Returns the simulated present working directory of the agent
    return "/home/kernel_agent/knowledge_base"

def whoami():
    # Returns the unique agent identifier (randomly generated for this example)
    agent_id = f"agent_{random.randint(1000, 9999)}"
    return agent_id

def help_cmd():
    # Returns a help string listing available commands
    return "Available commands: ls, cd <directory>, pwd, whoami, help"

# Function to process a single command
def process_command(command):
    if command == "ls":
        return ls()
    elif command.startswith("cd "):
        directory = command.split(" ", 1)[1]
        return cd(directory)
    elif command == "pwd":
        return pwd()
    elif command == "whoami":
        return whoami()
    elif command == "help":
        return help_cmd()
    else:
        return "Command not recognized."

# Main agent processing function, interprets input and generates output
def kernel_agent(prompt):
    # Split prompt into separate commands
    commands = prompt.split(";")
    responses = []

    for command in commands:
        response = process_command(command.strip())
        responses.append(response)
    
    # Generate final response
    final_response = "\n".join(responses)
    return final_response

# Read prompt from STDIN and process it
if __name__ == "__main__":
    prompt_input = sys.stdin.read()
    result = kernel_agent(prompt_input)
    
    # Output the result to STDOUT
    print(result)

# --- End of fenced Python code block ---

# In a real-world scenario, you would execute this script and pipe the output to both STDOUT and STDERR as appropriate.
Save this as main.py and you can run it using the command given in your example which pipes output to STDOUT and appends to log files:


python main.py 2>&1 | tee -a logs/app.log logs/python-app.log
Keep in mind that as your cognitive frame generator cognosis becomes more sophisticated, you will need to continually refine and adapt this code. You'd include features like state persistence between invocations, more complex command parsing, actual NLP capabilities, and proper integration with a version control system like Git so that each agent's codebase could be tagged with a unique version corresponding to its 'lifetime.' Integration with an NLP model such as OpenAI's would allow the agent to generate human-like responses to prompts.

Other considerations for future iterations would include authentication for secure API interactions, proper exception handling, and more intricate state management allowing the agent to learn and adapt from previous interactions.
