    management, such as opening and closing files, acquiring and releasing locks,
    or establishing and terminating network connections.

    Implementers should override the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods according to
    the resource's specific setup and cleanup procedures.

    Methods
    -------
    __enter__()

    __exit__(exc_type, exc_value, traceback)

    Notes
    -----
    It's important that implementations of `__exit__` method should return `False` to
